= : Evolving to Microservices

+++<h2>+++
SmartThings Case Study
+++</h2>+++

[.notes]
--
We have been on a 4 year journey evolving our architecture at SmartThings. Moving from 1 monolith and 3 supporting services to more than 100 microservices. Expanding from a US only platform to a world wide IoT platform. Our architecture has been shaped by product and organizational needs. We will go through the major architectural eras as we iterated on our platform.

Detail Bullets:
Some areas we will touch on; for each of 3 eras in our evolution:
Why did we pick this design?
What worked?
What was painful?
When was it time to change?


Eras:
Monolith  (1)


Monolith+ (3)
Why? Solve the pain from just a monolith but 
Worked? Technology suited to the connection was selected for each, 
Painful? Getting hard to test limited features, dragging in changes too early to different 
Change? Started to hit scaling issues, how to support global rollout quickly, too many conflicting changes when trying to experiment
Global Layer MicroServices (7)
Why? Needed to support multiple geos all at once
Worked? Quick escape valve for scale issues, simple geo deployments
Painful?  Still couldn’t scale different operations in different ways, too many conflicting changes when trying to experiment
Change? Couldn’t scale different workloads differently in different geos 
Layers of Microservices / Breaking up the Monolith  (The era of fit into one of these categories 60-80)
Why? Teams, were just starting to take on call for their own services. Not clear everyone had strong operational skills
Worked? Easy to reason about different services as we peel out functionality 
Painful? As we get more custom use cases per service fitting things into the buckets was hard and it was too hard to make new buckets, reasoning about the system is getting harder
Change? We outgrew the need 
Use case driven microservices deployments  (The era of do the best thing 130+)
Why? Flexibility to do the right thing
Worked? React to evolving regulations architecturally smoothly, cost optimizations,  teams can easily 
Painful? Building tools to support every use case, observability, reasoning about the system as a whole becomes hard
Change? Current


Other areas I will dig into:
What patterns emerged that we still use?
Thin persistent connections
Routing keys / gizmo style
Doing 
What patterns failed us and why?
Defined categories - too ridged, limited engineers thinking of solutions
Building generic first -- too costly, sometimes miss at primitives
Will that monolith ever really die? 
Or does the rest of the system grow to eclipse it?
Slower if you are reworking core features instead of just breaking it up. Rebuild / replacement with competing features is hard
Did we just make a really hard to deploy monolith? 
Almost at times. 
Our checklist for a new service.

== Agenda

* Intro
* What is SmartThings
* Eras of Our Architecture 
* What Failed for Us
* Patterns Working Across Eras
* Will that Monolith Ever Really Die

== Networking

To the people around you:

 * What company or organization are you from?
 * What they're looking to take away from this case study?

include::shared/about-st.adoc[]

== Why Call It Era

The architecture changed over time the lines between each era are blurry.

== What Failed for Us

You should try something else then these ideas.

=== Defined Categories

 * Too ridged
 * Limited engineers thinking of solutions


=== Building Generic First 

 * Too costly
 * Sometimes miss at primitives
 
== Patterns Working Across Eras

No matter what era of architecture, these work for us.

== Thin Persistent Connectors

A service that maintains a connect ideally has 0 logic outside of the connection.

 * Allows deployments to not disconnect hubs/devices
 * Small easy to maintain, hopefully mostly off the shelf.
 
== Routing Keys

 * Allows Moving URLs without rewritting all destinations.
 * Allows telling a cordiantor where to route


=== Example

@startuml
title SmartThings Device Control Plane
rectangle Global {
    rectangle Conductor as "Conductor"
    rectangle emissary as "OCF Backend"
}

rectangle Regional {
    rectangle ApiGateway
    rectangle mqtt as "MQTT Backend"
}

rectangle Shard {
    rectangle viper as "Backend"
    rectangle widget as "Hub Backend"
    rectangle dth as "Legacy Backend"
}



ApiGateway -> Conductor : api requests

Conductor --(0)-- mqtt  
Conductor -(0)- emissary
Conductor --(0)-- viper
Conductor --(0)-- dth
Conductor --(0)-- widget

== Tooling 

Build tooling only looking ahead 1 era and plan on deprecation.

=== Deployment Tooling

Spinnaker with 5 microservices is too heavy.

Spinnaker with 100+ works great.

== Paved Path

Creating a documented tooled path that covers your 80% case.


== Will that Monolith Ever Really Die
