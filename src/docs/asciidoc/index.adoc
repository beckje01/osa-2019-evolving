= : Evolving to Microservices

+++<h2>+++
SmartThings Case Study
+++</h2>+++



== Agenda

* Intro
* What is SmartThings
* Eras of Our Architecture 
* What Failed for Us
* Patterns Working Across Eras
* Will that Monolith Ever Really Die

== Networking

To the people around you:

 * What company or organization are you from?
 * What are you all looking to take away from this case study?

== Why Call It Era

The architecture changed over time the lines between each era are blurry.

== What Failed for Us

You should try something else then these ideas.

=== Defined Categories

 * Too rigid
 * Limited engineers thinking of solutions


=== Building Generic First 

 * Too costly
 * Sometimes miss at primitives

=== Automated Architecture Diagrams

As system got advanced enough there was no longer use from the automated architecture view.

 
== Patterns Working Across Eras

No matter what era of architecture, these work for us.

== Human Made Diagrams

A drillable diagram. High level moving to details of functional areas.

=== Example 

image::overview.png[alt, width=auto, height=400]

=== Example

image::api.png[alt, width=auto, height=400]

== Thin Persistent Connectors

A service that maintains a connect ideally has 0 logic outside of the connection.

 * Allows deployments to not disconnect hubs/devices
 * Small easy to maintain, hopefully mostly off the shelf.
 
== Routing Keys

 * Allows Moving URLs without rewritting all destinations.
 * Allows telling a coordinator where to route


=== Example 

 [plantuml%interactive, imagesPUML/deviceapi, svg,width=400,height=400]

rectangle Global {
    rectangle Conductor as "Conductor"
    rectangle emissary as "OCF Backend"
}

rectangle Regional {
    rectangle ApiGateway
    rectangle mqtt as "MQTT Backend"
}

rectangle Shard {
    rectangle viper as "Backend"
    rectangle widget as "Hub Backend"
    rectangle dth as "Legacy Backend"
}



ApiGateway -> Conductor : api requests

Conductor --(0)-- mqtt  
Conductor -(0)- emissary
Conductor --(0)-- viper
Conductor --(0)-- dth
Conductor --(0)-- widget

== Tooling 

Build tooling only looking ahead 1 era and plan on deprecation.

=== Deployment Tooling

Spinnaker with 5 microservices is too heavy.

Spinnaker with 100+ works great.

== Paved Path

Creating a documented tooled path that covers your 80% case.

== Break Out Auth First

Auth systems are so important to everything done you should always break them out first. 

Allows adding new services without interacting with the old monolith.

== Will that Monolith Ever Really Die?

You have tons of new services but that old big one is still there...

=== Does it have to die?

 * Does the rest of the system grow to eclipse it?
 * Can we still operate it?
 * Can we isolate it off behind some cleaner services?

=== Monolith as Legacy Support

If you can still operate this system and everything isn't depending on it you can effectively keep the monolith in a corner 

== How do we know it's not a distributed Monolith

 * When you start seeing outages not cascade.
 * When deployments of the service graph don't matter to every team.
