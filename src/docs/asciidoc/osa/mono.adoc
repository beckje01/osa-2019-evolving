=== Why did we pick this design?

First iteration, make something work with the least amount of work.

=== What worked?

 * Quick/Simple Deployment
 * Debugging was all one place to look.

=== What was painful?

* Hard to solve all connectivity with one codebase 
  * Mobile Client 
  * Website 
  * Hubs (Devices)

=== When was it time to change?

When we had lots of different things connected in different ways.
