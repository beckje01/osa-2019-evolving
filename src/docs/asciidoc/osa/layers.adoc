== Layers of Microservices 
Breaking up the Monolith is now a goal.

We created these categories of microservices that should have common operational patterns.


=== What it looked like

image::layers-black.png[layers,width=auto,height=500]

=== Why did we pick this design?

 * Teams were just starting to take over on call
 * Wanted to allow teams in a timezone to build their own service

=== What worked?

 * Easy to reason about different services operationally
 * Creation of paved path

=== What was painful?

 * Reasoning about the whole system functionality is getting harder
 * Fitting new workloads etc into existing buckets
 * When is it worth creating a new "bucket"

=== When was it time to change?

We outgrew the need for making services operate the same way.

Why? Teams, were just starting to take on call for their own services. Not clear everyone had strong operational skills
Worked? Easy to reason about different services as we peel out functionality 
Painful? As we get more custom use cases per service fitting things into the buckets was hard and it was too hard to make new buckets, reasoning about the system is getting harder
Change? We outgrew the need
