== Global Layer μ-Services

A small set of services available globally, with our core deployed in different geos.

=== What it looked like

=== Why did we pick this design?

 * Support multiple geographies at once.
 * Minimal change to support business needs.
 * Global services were new to us so limiting how many we needed

=== What worked?

 * Quick escape valve for scale issues, just add another shard.
 * Minimal changes to mobile clients and hubs.
 * Pulled out Auth / User to a Microservice


=== What was painful?

 * Couldn't scale different operations in different ways
 * Too many conflicting changes when trying to experiment.

=== When was it time to change?

 * Couldn't scale different workloads in different geographies
 * Team has grown too big to share a codebase
 * Team is now distributed around the globe

Why? Needed to support multiple geos all at once
Worked? Quick escape valve for scale issues, simple geo deployments
Painful?  Still couldn’t scale different operations in different ways, too many conflicting changes when trying to experiment
Change? Couldn’t scale different workloads differently in different geos
